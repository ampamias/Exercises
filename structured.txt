My example of unstructured text is Mayor Bowser’s Public Calendar daily posts. The posts give the public information about what 
Bowser is doing at her job every day. It gives times and the name of the event with a description of it and a location. 

This is Tuesday’s post: http://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-public-calendar-tuesday-february-9-2016

It is useful to organize this data because it helps to understand how busy the mayor is and what what issues she is concentrating 
more on. For example, at the end of her term, a reporter could write a story about her dedication overall and be able to give 
specific numbers. I know that she is notorious for being significantly late to events so being able to quickly she the average time 
of delay would be an interesting story. 

I think the events that Bowser has attended or the meetings she has sat in or conducted should be organized by date, time, location, 
event type, if it was press open, cabinet members that attended the event with her, length of event, and how many minutes after the set time the event started.
